# OnlineLibrarySystem
This is a team project about an Online Library System. This Online Library System will let user create an account, allows them to checkout any items(books, audiobooks, DVDs, etc.), search the list of books, etc. The Library System will automatically fine the users if they are overdue for books. Overall, a fun and challenging program, but working with my team made it much easier. Be sure to add the gson and json external jar files.
